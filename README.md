GirdThySword is a King James Bible memorization app that uses spaced repetition for effective scheduling of time of review of Bible verses. Using the tabbed interface, it's easy to know what to memorize on a particular day.

GirdThySword makes use of speech recognition in order to evaluate how well you have memorized a certain section of the Bible. A King James Bible is also integrated as a part of the app which distinguishes the verses that are memorized or added for memorizing from those that are not.
